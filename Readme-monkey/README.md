# The Monkey Lang

This small project tries to implement Recursive Descent Parser where the parser goes through each node Individually and recursively evaluates the statements, going through the token , checking the token types, then checking the identifier type, and at going through the expression , creating a syntax tree. Again the project is not meant to be used for actual programming. It's not complete and has a lots of bugs as of now. 

## Things that have been completed

#### 1) Lexer (the only part of the program that is completed with a working REPL)
#### 2) Let parser and some interfaces and structs for the AST.

Yikes, it's not a lot but hopefully the project will be over by this week. I kind of wanted to list things that is left to be done but listing them will just be embarrassing. Lol
