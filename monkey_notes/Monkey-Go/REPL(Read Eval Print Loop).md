REPL is the console of the language. It let's you define identifiers, print things and take input from the console itself. Many language support this feature .There are lots of good utilities of this feature , the main one being it makes things easier to debug. Many debuggers take inputs from console thus it's a good addition to have. Plus you can run the code in console itself rather than having to make an IDE for the lang which is stupid and dumb.
