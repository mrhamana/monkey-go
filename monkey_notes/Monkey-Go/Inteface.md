## The Function Signature

Signature of the function refers to how the function is called in a programming language. This includes, 
1) Function Name
2) Parameters and it's types (some languages do not require types of their parameter)
3) Return Type (not mandatory for  some languages)

Note: In Golang the signature of the function requires all of these things . Here's an example.
 `func Myfunc(int a, int b) string`. This was important to define because of the upcoming definition.

## Contracts 

Refers to the formal agreement between different parts of the program - usually between function , class or interface. It a blueprint for any class which should be implemented whatever's declared in the interface.
